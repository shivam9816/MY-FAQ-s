            <p>The next step is designing your FAQ page. We have some handy tips for doing this located in the next section of this post. But, if you can't wait until then, here's a jump link so you can skip on down.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h4>Publish the FAQ page on your site.</h4>

            <p>Once your FAQ page is ready, it's time to publish it to your website. Most companies will provide a link to the FAQ page in their website's main navigation bar, so no matter where they are on the site, visitors can go directly to the page if they need help.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h4>Monitor the FAQ page's performance.</h4>

            <p>With your page up and running, customers should be more successful in finding solutions to common problems. To find out if that's the case, you'll need to revisit the customer data that you used to create an online FAQ page in the first place.</p>

    <div class="accordian">
        <div class="question">
            <h4>Update content and add more solutions over time.</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>As your business grows, you should update your FAQ page to include any new questions that become popular over time. For example, if you release a new product or service you'll need to update your FAQ page so that it includes troubleshooting tips for this offer as well. This shows that you take customer success seriously and that you're rolling out new products and services that your team knows how to support.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h4>Use service data to identify your most common questions.</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Your FAQ page should address the most common questions customers have about your products, services, and brand as a whole. The best way to identify those questions is to tap into your customer service data and see which problems customers are consistently reaching out to you with.</p>
